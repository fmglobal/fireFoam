- One dimensional pyrolysis configuration based on FPA configuration, e.g., DOI: 10.3801/IAFSS.FSS.11-165
- Gas-phase solution de-acativated
- Heat flux imposed at solid-gas interface in 0/fuelRegion/T BC
- Sample thickness set in system/extrudeToRegionMeshDic.fuelRegion and constant/pyrolysisZones
- runtime post-processing provides mass, mlr, and surface temperature traces
